# Lab 2 Reflection

The working map is here: https://ajdreher.github.io/AJDreher-web/song.map.html

## Who did you design your map for? What questions or needs does the map attempt to raise or address? In what respects is your map successful and unsuccessful in this?
I designed this map for myself mainly (read the text on the map to understand why I chose to make this map). Ideally, it would have saved the markers that other people added to it, and became richer over time, the way the website Queering the Map does. However, I realized eventually that I would need a server or something to do this, or there would be privacy issues (still don't really understand this). So I failed to accomplish this goal because of constraints that I still don't fully understand. I still think the map is useful though, because it gave me insights about the music I listen to, and may give others insights too, and also share some new music with users.
## What process did you follow in the design/iteration of the map? 
I had an idea in my head about what I wanted the map to look like and the interactivity capabilities. I started by setting the basemap and then adding a Geojson that I had created myself using QGIS (the yellow markers). Then I added the popups for those points, using the Tabby plugin because I had seen another map with tabbed popups and I wanted to see if I could do that. For some reason the tabs don't work in the GitHub Pages link above. But they did work on the .html I opened in Chrome from my files that I used to test my progress while making the map. Same code. I don't know what the reason for this is, and by this point I don't have hours to spend figuring it out. Picture below of the tabbed popups. The next step I took was to add the info on the sidebar and the interactive element where a user can add their own points. I didn't succeed in making the popups for the added markers tabbed either.
## How does your map incorporate interactivity in a way that adds understanding? 
People can click on the markers and get info about the songs, including being able to watch the video and listen to the song. They can also add their own points to the map. With these features, they can explore my song geography as well as map their own.
## What are the intellectual justifications for your choices of data and cartographic stylings?
I used gold icons for another assignment and liked the look so I used them on this map as well. I used a pretty simple basemap that did not include topography because that information would be irrelevant. 
## In what ways could your map be improved? 
I couldn't figure out how to make the "Add a Song to the Map!" button go away after it was clicked. In addition, for the tabbed popups to work, you had to "x" out of one popup before clicking on another marker, or else the popup for the second marker you clicked on would not be tabbed. Also as I mentioned before, it would be nice if the points that other users added were saved. And also if the tabs worked on the public version of the map.

A marker I added using the interactivity tools for "Sweet Home Alabama" (please note that I do not endorse the political views of this band)
